# SE577 Roll-Your-Own Course Project

One of the primary objectives of this course is to obtain realistic hands-on experience designing and building software with a modern architecture.  The course has an [out-of-the-box course project](./SE577-Project.adoc) with a series of six small deliverables that involve:

1. Creating a modern front end using Single Page Application (SPA) technologies
2. Creating a series of web-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
3. Creating APIs that integrate with a modern cloud service
4. Demonstrating the ability to deal with modern design constraints such as proxying requests and dealing with modern security protocols (e.g., oAuth)
5. Working with modern engineering tools such as GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes

The stock project is designed to help students incrementally build a prototype application that covers depth of the concepts we will be covering in class.  The project is intended to focus on software architecture concepts, and not on developing a lot of code. 

Realizing that many of our full time students work in research labs, or in industry, I am also providing you with the opportunity to roll-your-own project that better aligns to areas of your personal interest. Note your project does not have the same architecture as the stock course project - it just has to have an interesting software architecture.

### Deliverables

If you choose to create your own project, you will need to start by **creating proposal** that outlines your project objectives and a schedule of deliverables.  The purpose of this proposal is so that we can get on the same page on your project, agree with proposed deliverables, and that I am comfortable with building your proposed project is both realistic and aligns to having an interesting software architecture.  If you want to go this route, by the end of week 2 you send me a proposal for your project. This proposal must include:

1. An abstract describing the functional objectives of your project.  In other words what will your project do once its constructed?
    
2.  A rough set of deliverables (at least 4) that you will prepare and submit over the term to demonstrate that you are on track to complete your project by the end of the term. Your first and final project deliverables should replicate the stock project.  The first deliverable is to setup a web-hosted git repo such as GitHub, and the last deliverable outlining the requirements to submit your final project.
    
3. A clear statement on the "initial state" of your project.  Ideally this project would start from scratch, but I am also OK with taking an existing codebase and extending, and/or rearchitecting this code.  You just need to clearly identify where you are starting from.  If your proposal does not mention an "initial starting state" then I will assume you are starting your project from scratch.

4. Highlighting some learning or stretch objectives of your project. We will be using programming languages, frameworks and toolchains that are likely new to students in this class.  While I provide flexibility on how much or little of this you integrate into your project, I like when students stretch themselves and will happily trade off functional project requirements if students are working on incorporating some new technologies in their projects.  For example, mentioning things like *"I would like to use this project as an opportunity to learn Go"* will help me to calibrate your project work with my expectations. 

After you submit your proposal I will review and either approve, deny, or most likely provide feedback that I would like to see incorporated into your project.

If you have any questions please reach out to me to setup a meeting or visit my open office hours. 

### Grading
Like the stock course project, the first (3 points) and last deliverable (12 points) add up to 15 points.  The total project has been weighted with a total of 60 points.  If you check out Blackboard's grade center you will see 4 intermediate deliverables.  I will reuse the grading placeholders in blackboard for your project, although the descriptions will not align with your proposed deliverables.  *Do not worry about this, I will adjust what you submit to fit this structure while still adding up to 60 total points.* 

### Teams
You may work individually or in small teams (max 4 people) for custom projects.  Make sure that you mention that you will be working in a team in your proposal and that what you plan to design and build aligns to the number of members in your team.
