# SE577 Lecture Format

From the [course description](SE577-CourseDescription.md) this course is broken into two parts.  The first half of the course covers Software Architecture fundamentals, and the second half covers modern software architecture concepts.  This course also has a class project requirement where you will play the role of the architect, lead designer and lead developer in order to practice the concepts covered in this class.

In order to complete the project, I will need to pull forward some basic concepts from the tail end of the course to the front end of the course so that you can work on various project deliverables along the way.

For the first half of the course, weekly lectures will be time boxed to one hour and fourty minutes, and one hour will be dedicated to technical content.  We will also have a 10 min break mixed into each lecture. 

The technical components we will be covering in the first half of this course include:

* Introduction to Typescript
* Introduction to Server Side Web (focus will be on Vue.js)
* Introduction to creating a basic web API
* Introduction to containerization with Docker
* Introduction to container coordination with Docker Compose and Kubernetes

I will be updating this page from time to time with additional resources such as video tutorials available on YouTube for students who need additional help.

### Supplemental Online Resources
